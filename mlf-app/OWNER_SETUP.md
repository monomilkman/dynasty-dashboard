# Owner Name Configuration ✅ COMPLETE

The owner mappings have been fully configured in `lib/owner-mappings.ts` with historical data from 2021-2024.

## Configuration Status

### ✅ 2024 Season (12 teams) - COMPLETE
All 12 franchise owners are mapped with real names

### ✅ 2023 Season (16 teams) - COMPLETE  
All 16 franchise owners are mapped with real names

### ✅ 2022 Season (16 teams) - COMPLETE
All 16 franchise owners are mapped with real names

### ✅ 2021 Season (16 teams) - COMPLETE
All 16 franchise owners are mapped with real names

## League History Notes

- **2021-2023**: 16-team league
- **2024**: Downsized to 12-team league (franchises 0013-0016 no longer active)

## How It Works

Since the MyFantasyLeague API doesn't provide owner names for this league, the app uses manual mappings in `lib/owner-mappings.ts`. The `getOwnerName()` function automatically selects the correct mapping based on the year.

All historical team names and owner changes have been preserved, so the app will display accurate information for any year.

## Current Status

The app is currently showing:
- ✅ **Team Names**: Working correctly from MFL API
- ✅ **Owner Names**: Using manual mapping (needs real names)
- ✅ **Scoring Data**: Total points from MFL API
- ❓ **Detailed Scoring**: Starters/Bench/Offense/Defense not available from MFL API

## Missing Data Explanation

The detailed scoring breakdowns (Starters vs Bench, Offense vs Defense, Potential Points) are not available through the MFL API for this league. These are typically calculated client-side on the MFL website from individual player scoring data.

The current implementation shows:
- **Starters**: Same as Total (MFL doesn't separate)
- **Bench**: Shows "-" (not available)
- **Offense**: Same as Total (MFL doesn't separate)
- **Defense**: Shows "-" (not available)
- **Total**: Correct total points from MFL
- **Potential**: Shows "-" (not available)

If you need this detailed breakdown, it would require fetching individual player scores for all players and calculating the aggregates, which would be much more complex and slower.
