#### Integration Completed ✅
**Final Integration Step**: All 6 edits to `app/components/PlayoffProjections.tsx` applied successfully:

1. **Add imports** (line 7):
```typescript
import { batchUpdateSnapshots, getProbabilityChange } from '@/lib/playoff-history'
import TeamDetailModal from './TeamDetailModal'
```

2. **Add probabilityChanges state** (after line 18):
```typescript
const [probabilityChanges, setProbabilityChanges] = useState<Record<string, number | null>>({})
```

3. **Update fetchPlayoffData function** (in lines 58-67, after setProbabilities):
```typescript
// Save historical snapshot and calculate changes
batchUpdateSnapshots(
  year,
  week,
  probs.map(p => {
    const standing = standingsData.leagueStandings.franchise.find(
      (f: StandingsFranchise) => f.id === p.franchiseId
    )
    return {
      franchiseId: p.franchiseId,
      franchiseName: standing?.name || p.franchiseId,
      playoffProbability: p.playoffProbability,
      divisionWinProbability: p.divisionWinProbability,
      avgSeed: p.averageSeed,
      wins: standing?.h2hw || 0,
      losses: standing?.h2hl || 0,
      ties: standing?.h2ht || 0,
      pointsFor: standing?.pf || 0,
      gamesBack: 0
    }
  })
)

const changes: Record<string, number | null> = {}
probs.forEach(p => {
  changes[p.franchiseId] = getProbabilityChange(p.franchiseId, year, week)
})
setProbabilityChanges(changes)
```

4. **Add getChangeIndicator function** (after line 122):
```typescript
const getChangeIndicator = (change: number | null): string => {
  if (change === null) return ''
  if (change > 5) return '↑↑'
  if (change > 0) return '↑'
  if (change < -5) return '↓↓'
  if (change < 0) return '↓'
  return '→'
}
```

5. **Update playoff % table cell** (replace lines 282-292):
```typescript
<td className="px-4 py-4 whitespace-nowrap text-center">
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
      <span className={`text-lg font-bold ${getStatusColor(team.playoffProbability)}`}>
        {team.playoffProbability.toFixed(1)}%
      </span>
      {probabilityChanges[team.franchiseId] !== undefined && (
        <span className={`text-xs ${
          (probabilityChanges[team.franchiseId] || 0) > 0
            ? 'text-green-600 dark:text-green-400'
            : (probabilityChanges[team.franchiseId] || 0) < 0
            ? 'text-red-600 dark:text-red-400'
            : 'text-gray-400'
        }`}>
          {getChangeIndicator(probabilityChanges[team.franchiseId])}
        </span>
      )}
    </div>
    {prob && prob.averageSeed > 0 && (
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
        Avg Seed: {prob.averageSeed.toFixed(1)}
      </span>
    )}
  </div>
</td>
```

6. **Add TeamDetailModal component** (before closing div at line 331):
```typescript
{selectedTeam && (
  <TeamDetailModal
    isOpen={!!selectedTeam}
    onClose={() => setSelectedTeam(null)}
    franchiseId={selectedTeam}
    probability={probabilities.find(p => p.franchiseId === selectedTeam)!}
    standing={standings.find(s => s.id === selectedTeam)!}
    divisions={divisions!}
    schedule={schedules.find(s => s.franchiseId === selectedTeam)!}
    currentWeek={currentWeek}
    year={year}
  />
)}
```

#### Technical Challenges Encountered
- **Hot-reload file locking**: Next.js dev server auto-restarts prevented file edits
- Attempted solutions: kill-port, taskkill commands (Windows compatibility issues)
- **TypeScript errors fixed**:
  - TeamSchedule.avgOpponentPoints (calculated from remainingGames array)
  - Optional opponentAvgPoints handling (|| 0 fallback)

#### Files Modified
- ✅ `lib/playoff-history.ts` (new)
- ✅ `app/components/PlayoffProbabilityChart.tsx` (new)
- ✅ `app/components/TeamDetailModal.tsx` (new)
- ✅ `app/components/DivisionStandings.tsx` (new)
- ✅ `app/components/PlayoffProjections.tsx` (integrated - 6 edits applied)
- ✅ `app/page.tsx` (added Playoff Tracker view)

#### Build Status
- ✅ All components compile successfully
- ✅ `npm run dev` running without errors
- ✅ TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Tested in browser - all features working

#### Testing Results ✅
- ✅ Playoff tracker page loads and displays probabilities
- ✅ Monte Carlo simulation completes (10,000 iterations)
- ✅ Team rows are clickable
- ✅ TeamDetailModal opens with complete data
- ✅ Historical probability chart displays
- ✅ Probability change indicators (↑/↓) working
- ✅ Modal closes with Escape key
- ✅ localStorage persistence working
