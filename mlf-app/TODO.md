## 📋 Phase 3 Planning (After Playoff Tracker Complete)

### Player-Level Analysis
- [ ] Create `/api/mfl/players` endpoint
- [ ] Build PlayerStats component
- [ ] Add player comparison tools
- [ ] Implement player search functionality

### Advanced Filtering
- [ ] Search functionality across components
- [ ] Filter combinations (position + week + team)
- [ ] Saved filter presets in localStorage
- [ ] Export filtered data

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement React Query for API caching
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support
- [ ] Optimize Chart.js rendering
- [ ] Lazy load heavy components

### UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Add loading skeletons

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Fixed This Session
- ✅ TypeScript: `avgOpponentPoints` property on TeamSchedule
- ✅ TypeScript: Optional `opponentAvgPoints` handling
- ✅ Build errors: All components compile successfully

### Active Issues
- ⚠️ **Dev server hot-reload prevents file edits** - Solution: Stop dev server before editing
- ⚠️ **Chart.js memory leaks** - Minor, needs component cleanup improvements

### MFL API Considerations
- Rate limiting handled with fallback data
- Some endpoints return 429 during heavy development
- Fallback strategies implemented in all API routes

## 📚 Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
- [ ] Improve error messages with user-friendly text
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to utility functions
- [ ] Standardize loading state patterns across components

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for playoff calculator
- [ ] Add integration tests for API routes
- [ ] Test all components with Playwright
- [ ] Add error boundary components

### Documentation
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created
- [x] TODO.md created (this file)
- [ ] API documentation for all endpoints
- [ ] Component usage examples
- [ ] Deployment guide
